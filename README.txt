To play the game, extract everything from the .zip and open the executable. If you can't do that, please don't ever consider majoring in computer science.

This game is free. Free as in free speech. And as in free b... uh, as in free candy. Basically, do whatever you want with it. I don't care. Copy it to a flash drive and use it for target practice, post nasty comments all over the Internet about how terrible it is, whatever. The source code is distributed under the zlib/libpng license and can be found here: https://github.com/meh2481/pony48

As much as I like programming, I can't claim to be a musician, artist, voice actor, or anything else, so some other awesome people helped in that regard (By "helped," I mean I completely stole everything from them). See credit.txt for a full list of 'em. If I used something of yours and you don't like it, let me know! I'll remove it / beg and plead to keep using it / make promises and not follow through / etc.

Most importantly, have fun and pony on! inDerpxar out.
