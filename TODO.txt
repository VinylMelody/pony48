-OpenCV camera madness
-FMOD mic madness
-Nukes?
-Bop-It?
-Support mouse
-Joystick list in case multiple controllers connected - most recent one used for board-tilt-testing
-Support as many mouse buttons as SDL2 can handle
-Touchscreen support?
-Rebindable controller - rebind axes, buttons, etc
-Lua-controlled menu thing - ask fgen how he did it
-Menu screens shouldn't just appear; make them more flashy
-Movement with mouse:
	-foreground arrows as mouse is moved to say which direction the tiles will shift
	-Alpha of foreground arrows depends on position: alpha of 0 near the center, near 1 near the edge
	-arrows move + wrap
