-OpenCV camera madness
-FMOD mic madness
-Bop-It gameover sound
-Joystick list in case multiple controllers connected - most recent one used for board-tilt-testing
-Touchscreen support?
-Rebindable controller - rebind axes, buttons, etc
-Lua-controlled menu thing - ask fgen how he did it
-Menu screens shouldn't just appear; make them more flashy
-Warning before resetting the game if press MMB or Y
-SFX
-VOX
-Make tiles appear slower/slide faster so that they don't appear while another tile is sliding over that location
-Make bored sfx only play if game hasn't been minimized/in background
-Test and see if 8192x256 image even works with lower-end lappy gfx card
