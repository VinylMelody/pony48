-OpenCV camera madness
-FMOD mic madness
-Bop-It gameover sound
-Joystick list in case multiple controllers connected - most recent one used for board-tilt-testing
-Touchscreen support?
-Rebindable controller - rebind axes, buttons, etc
-Lua-controlled menu thing - ask fgen how he did it
-Menu screens shouldn't just appear; make them more flashy
-Only rumble the controller if you're currently using the controller
