-OpenCV camera madness
-FMOD mic madness
-Different effects that happen at different points in a song
-Nukes
-Bop-It
-Support mouse
-If multiple controllers detected, press any button on either one to select it
-Support as many mouse buttons as SDL2 can handle
	-Test more buttons to see if SDL2 can sneakily handle them
-Controller rumble support (for what though?)
-Touchscreen support?
-Detect analog sticks, and tilt board based on actual direction and amount those are being pressed
